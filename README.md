# Differential-Algebraic-Equations

I studied mathematics and focused my final thesis on numerical methods. The work consisted of numerically solving algebraic differential equations (DAEs) by applying implicit Runge-Kutta methods. Basically, a DAE is a system of equations of the form:
y' = f(y,z)
0 = g(y,z)
where y and z are functions that in n and m variables respectively.  These problems are interesting because they appear in many sciences: engineering, physics, economics, etc. Apply these methods to solve two DAEs: one of them for the simple pendulum and the other for an amplifier.
